# About
[pico-network-serial-port](https://github.com/RajkumarGara/pico-network-serial-port) is designed to bridge TCP communication with UART controllers using a Raspberry Pi Pico W. This project facilitates seamless data transmission from TCP networks to UART-compatible devices. Ideal for IoT applications, this repository provides a robust framework for developers looking to connect network protocols with serial communication devices.

## Installing on Raspberry pi pico-w
